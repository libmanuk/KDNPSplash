# KDNPSplash

ðŸ“„ Whatâ€™s Inside

Each splash page is a self-contained HTML file.

The kdnpcsv.html file loads a CSV file from a relative path and uses the csv-to-html-table JavaScript plugin to render the data as a responsive, searchable table.

Includes minimal styling for easy customization or embedding.

ðŸ”§ Dependencies

This project uses:

- csv-to-html-table (loaded via CDN)
- jQuery and DataTables (automatically included by the plugin)
