      <p style="text-align: justify;">For over sixty years the <a href="http://libraries.uky.edu/" target="_blank">University of Kentucky Libraries</a> preserved Kentucky newspapers on microfilm and made them freely available to researchers, genealogists, and the general public. Today, the Kentucky Digital Newspaper Program (KDNP) brings those digitized-from-microfilm newspaper collections and born-digital newspapers to a global audience through the KDNP web interface that's fully keyword searchable. We’re always adding new content to our online collections and refining our technological processes to make the discovery and research processes as cutting edge as possible.</p>

<h3><a href="http://uknowledge.uky.edu/libraries_present/137/" target="_blank">Preserving Kentucky's Newspapers: Analogue Beginnings to Digital Frontier</a></h3>
<p>Learn more about UK Libraries' preservation program. From the early preservation efforts of Dr. Thomas D. Clark and UK Libraries’ Director Lawrance Thompson to the newspaper digitization frontier, this article provides an overview of the collection process over time.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.uky.edu/Libraries/NDNP/" target="_blank">KY-NDNP website</a></h3>
<p>As one of the first six awardee institutions in the <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/" target="_blank">National Digital Newspaper Program</a> (NDNP), our work with the Library of Congress and the National Endowment for the Humanities has been expansive. For a look at our earliest experiences in NDNP, this website includes multimedia productions, press releases, former advisory board members, and more.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.uky.edu/Libraries/NDNP/metamorphosis/index.html" target="_blank">meta | morphosis: microfilm-to-digital lecture series</a></h3>
<p>UK Libraries’ in-house experience with newspaper digitization created the on-site meta | morphosis: microfilm-to-digital institute in 2006. In 2011, the workshops were converted to a series of online tutorials for those unable to travel to the University of Kentucky campus. These self-paced teaching tutorials about newspaper digitization have been used for over a decade by institutions around the world training new staff in newspaper digitization. </p>
