                preserved Kentucky newspapers on microfilm and made them freely available to researchers, genealogists, and the general public. Today, the Kentucky Digital Newspaper Program (KDNP) brings those digitized-from-microfilm newspaper collections and born-digital newspapers to a global audience through the KDNP web interface that's fully keyword searchable. We're always adding new content to our online collections and refining our technological processes to make the discovery and research processes as cutting edge as possible.

                UK Libraries' in-house experience with newspaper digitization created the on-site meta | morphosis: microfilm-to-digital institute in 2006. In 2011, the workshops were converted to a series of online tutorials for those unable to travel to the University of Kentucky campus. These self-paced teaching tutorials about newspaper digitization have been used for over a decade by institutions around the world training new staff in newspaper digitization.
